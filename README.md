## Simple note taking app only for Android.

I believe that if you use simpler apps your life gets easier. That's why I decided to create this app.This app is as simple as it can be.

It has only the most basic features like:
- [x] adding notes,
- [x] editing notes,
- [x] saving notes locally,
- [x] deleting notes,
- [x] displaying notes in a list.
